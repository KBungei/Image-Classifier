# Image-Gallery
Simple a gallery web app written in HTML/CSS/JS that opens multiple image files and displays them in a responsive layout
I included adding captions and tags to images and functionality to search for image by tag
Future versions will include browser's indexeddb functionality

Currently WebApp works better on desktop
Click "Add+" button to open file dialog, select and open multiple images
Click on image to open larger view, use left/right to navigate prev/next images

WebApp deployed here:
